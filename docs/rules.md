# Raid Rules

## General Rules

1. We regularly do BWL on Saturdays at 6am, MC on Sundays at 6am (server time). We will start on time, so please be on time.
  a. Please let us know at least 4 hours before the raid if you are going to be late or absent.
  b. If you are more than 15 minutes late *without notice*, you will lose **1** SR of your choice.
  c. Regardless of notice, if you join the raid after we pull the 3rd boss (Lashlayer for BWL), you will lose **1** SR of your choice; if you join the raid after we pull the 7th boss (Chromaggus for BWL), you will lose **both** SRs.
2. For **current content** (BWL), raiders are expected to come regularly to our raids on a **fixed character and spec**.
  a. You are expected to save your lockout on your fixed character for the guild raid.
  b. New members/PUGs will only be able to place SRs on their **second** consecutive lockout.
  c. If you miss a raid *without notice*, you will be considered a "new member" and can only make SRs on your **second** consecutive lockout.
  d. If you decide to switch character/spec, please let us know at least 24h in advance. We will reach out to you in private to discuss gear priority in order to protect other raiders' gear progression.
  e. If you roll on a piece of gear/token for the second time (regardless of your spec), the roll will be OS.
3. For **current content** (BWL), full consumes/enchants are required.
4. For non-current or more casual content (MC/ZG/World Bosses/etc.), alts are welcome.

## Loot Rules

### MC/BWL: 2SR > MS > OS (+1)
1. We are still doing `2SR > MS > OS`. The usual rules for SR still hold.
  a. Double-SR means you get to roll twice until you get the item, the higher roll counts.
  b. Legendaries, mats and recipes are HR'd to guild.
  c. Gear with Spell Damage = Spell Healing (like Lok'amir) is Caster DPS prio; Spell Damage < Spell Healing is Healer prio.
2. Starting next week (Nov 9 raid), we will add a `+1` to non-SR rolls. That means when you win an item with a non-SR roll, you will have a "debuff" (`+1`) that makes your subsequent non-SR rolls lower priority than those without this debuff (`+0`). Similarly, if you win another item with a non-SR roll, you will gain another stack of this debuff (now you have `+2`), and your rolls will have lower priority than those without the debuff (`+0`) or with only 1 stack (`+1`). Note that MS rolls will still have priority over OS rolls.
3. In summary, `2SR > MS+0 > MS+1 > MS+2 > ... > OS`.
4. The rationale of adding this rule is to protect raiders who have been consistently raiding with us. This prevents PUGs and new characters from SR-ing rare non-tier items while also vacuuming many tier tokens (b/c tier tokens are less contended towards the end of the phase).
5. Legendaries, Mats, Recipes are still reserved to the guild.

### Other Raids: 1SR/2SR

1. We will do either 1SR or 2SR, depending on drops and what the group needs.
2. The guild may HR 1-2 items, depending on the guild's needs.
